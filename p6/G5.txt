- Chris completed the insert.C file.
- Nico completed the select.C file.

At the end, we all helped with testing and debugging, making sure our output matched the canvas files. Nico was the primary leader of this part. 
We had some difficulty with testing our code because comparing the output was a tedious process. 

We also helped each other with finishing the methods and pointed out resources to each other on Canvas.
